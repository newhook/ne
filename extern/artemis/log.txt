[dd-mm-yyy]5-7-12:

-  Needs memory management.
-  Fixt circular dependencies for now.
-  Able to use

		  myEntity->getComponent<MyComponentClass>();

instead of:

			myEntity->getComponent(artemis::ComponentTypeManager::getTypeFor<MyComponentClass>());  

+Flattened namespace to 
>artemis:: 

instead of 

>artemis::component:: etc.  

***
[dd-mm-yyy]3-7-12:  

* Needs a lot of refractoring. Classes need to be disected in to seperate files.
* Having some Circular dependency issues. In Entity can't use template function:
myEntity->getComponent<MyComponentClass>();  

* For now this is the only solution:  

		myEntity->
		getComponent(
			artemis::component::ComponentTypeManager::getTypeFor<MyComponentClass>()
		);  

* Need to reduce pointer usage.
